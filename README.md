# Welcome to the course!

This folder contains the course material used to build the YT video, and you can run this locally to test the material in the video.

## Before Getting started

- The supabase project used to build this course are in .env.example file, so copy that and create a new .env file.
- A Github OAuth App is already configured to login "http://localhost:3000" and for this specific Supabase project.
- So you just have to run the project at localhost:3000 to login and use the app with our sample data.

## Getting started

From your terminal:

```sh
cd <into this folder>
npm install
npm run dev
```
